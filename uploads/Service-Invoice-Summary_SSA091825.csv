Water is backing up into machine, I believe this is due to the length of the grey hose connection from machine to waste point not allowing water to flow naturally, I feel as though a shortening of hose would rectify this issue, height of drain point to waste point is as per specs 

There is no water filter on machine, skope to confirm if this is required.

Ventilation is an issue, we only have 2.5 cm clearance above machine (ambient was 31 25 minutes into cycle) specs are asking for 5. 

I pulled machine out of space and lifted it whilst water was backed up and saw an instant improvement in drainage, if machine could be raised further I feel as though drainage would improve even further although I understand this is probably not possible.
